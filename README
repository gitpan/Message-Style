ABSTRACT
========

This is a module that takes an news article (or mail message) and
provides a score based on how well-written it is.

It's based on a script I wrote years ago called fsckwit.pl. For
obvious reasons, selecting Fsckwit.pm as the module name might not go
down too well with the CPAN maintainers, so it's been renamed to
something more innocuous.

INSTALLATION
============

a) Untar the archive
b) cd into the directory created
c) Makefile.PL
d) make
e) make install

USAGE
=====

See "perldoc Message::Style".
